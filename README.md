
eBay Website Clone CW-U3 Masai School

INTRODUCTION

Hello Guys, I’m Anand Singh, Again another blog where I will be sharing our experience of Project in 
Masai School
 Unit-3 Construct week. We had given a project to clone the website of eBay in our final week of Unit-3. In this project, We are a team of 6 members 
Anand Singh Yadav, Shubham Kashyap, Mahendra Singh, Sachin Kumar Keshri,NANDU DUMARE, and Monica Priya.

It was really an exciting week and we learned a lot of new technology and cool things during the building of our Project. I would say at the end of the week it was really worth the effort that we had put into building the project and seeing it working.
eBay: An International E-commerce Corporation
eBay is one of the oldest and most successful e-commerce websites on the Internet, but it doesn’t sell any items itself. Instead, it allows users to list items for sale, which other users can then bid on in auctions. Recently, eBay has also added options to buy items at face value, or submit price offers for them.

EXPERIENCE

We are a team of 6 members, we had a lot of fun and learned a lot of new stuff while cloning our website. We have gone through various issues while creating the clone website. But we were happy when everything got fixed in its place like pieces puzzle. There were a few issues we faced during this period. But in the end, we were happy with the outcome of our hard work.

PLATFORMS THAT WE HAD USED FOR COMMUNICATION

As we were working remotely, Slack and Zoom was the only app that helped us communicate with our teammates. We also used GitHub for creating and pushing our files and creating milestones. We had a fixed schedule by which we had to complete the given task for the day and at the end of each day, we have to show our progress to each other through zoom meetings. This was very helpful as we were able to decide how much we have covered as a team and what are changes required to make the page work properly.
